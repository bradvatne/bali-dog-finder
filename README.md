### About Me

I left my 3rd year of my Computer Science degree in late 2019 and set out travelling Southeast Asia. As the pandemic began to erupt in early 2020, I decided to settle in Bali. In November of 2020 I started learning Next.js. I built a few basic projects, then decided to tackle something a little more involved. I am now building my first real web-app, I'm engaged to my wonderfully supportive fiancee with a child on the way, and hoping to be employable soon. 

My goal for this project was to get a feel for the development process from start to finish and gain a true understanding of the technologies used. For this reason, I limited most of my research to within the documentation of the technologies used, rather than just copy + pasting from tutorials.

If you are interested in hiring a remote junior dev, or have a position in Bali that would suite my skillset, please contact me at bradvatne at gmail dot com.
